# Gender Classification Project
## Overview
This project aims to develop a gender classification system using machine learning techniques. The system takes an input image containing a human face and predicts the gender of the person in the image as either male or female.

## Features
- Uses state-of-the-art machine learning models for gender classification.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.
- Can be integrated into various applications such as security systems, demographic analysis tools, and more.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (for machine learning models)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Streamlit (for web application)

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions, bug reports, or want to contribute code, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
